cppyy on Ubuntu works fantastically. 

Installation with conda-forge
-----------------------------

```conda install -c conda-forge cppyy ``` worked out well. 


Installation with pip
---------------------

```pip install cppyy```

Also no problem at all running testing.py straight after pip installation. 


cppyy on Windows works well too
-------------------------------
```pip install cppyy``` and then running ```python testing.py``` works out pretty well too!
